INSTRUCTIONS FOR KIT COMPATIBILITY WITH FAITHS & POWERS

// 0.79.9

**********************************
STEP 1:

Add the "lib" folder next to this text file to the top level of your mod's main folder.  For example, if your mod is called "My Awesome Mod" and your weidu executable is called "setup-My_Awesome_Mod.exe" then you will likely have a folder titled "My_Awesome_Mod" and then subfolders like:
	- /My_Awesome_Mod/spells/
	- /My_Awesome_Mod/items/
	- etc.  
	
In this case, copy the "lib" folder so that it is 
	- /My_Awesome_Mod/lib/
	
If you already have a folder called "lib" at that location, you can just copy the two files from this package's "lib" folder into your "lib" folder.  If you already have "qdmulticlass.tpa" there (v0.10 or higher), then you only need to copy over the "fnp_compatibility.tpa" file.


**********************************
STEP 2:

In your mod, you presumably have some code that runs the Weidu ADD_KIT routine.  At the end of it, you probably have some code for the EE games that starts with "LAF fl#add_kit_ee."

After the fl#add_kit_ee routine, insert the entire contents of the "example_sphere_access.txt" file.  (If you want, you can delete all the commented material.  And in fact you can delete any row involving a variable you don't plan to use - see below on the variables.)


**********************************
STEP 3:

Now basically just follow the instructions in that block of code you just copied:

- Change the '0' to a '1' for the armor your kit can use.  (Paladins and Rangers can ignore this)

- Change the '0' to a number between '1' and '5' for the weapons your kit can use.  The number will determine how many proficiency points your kit can put in those weapons.  '0' means no proficiency AND no usability.  (Paladins and Rangers can ignore this.)

- For the 'class' variable, enter 'cleric' 'acolyte' 'druid' 'occultist' 'champion' 'zealot' 'ranger' or 'scout'. 

- For the 'multiclass' variable, put a single string of text that includes 'fc' and/or 'cr' and/or 'ct' and/or 'cm.' You can put "fc_ct_cm" or "ctcr" or whatever.  If the player installs the FnP Multiclass secondary mod, it will read these variables and automatically generate multiclass versions of your kit in each of the multiclasses you specify here.

- For the 'sphere_list' variable, you can leave it as "custom" (or delete that row entirely) if you plan to define your kit's sphere access.  But if you go through the "sphere_list_fnp.tpa" file in the FnP mod's "lib" folder, you will see a lot of pre-defined sphere lists, according to deity.  You can use on of those by entering e.g. "lathander_spheres" here, and your kit will have access to the spheres designated there.  Then you don't need to specify all of the spheres for your kit, and you can be sure it will be consistent with other kits devoted to the same deity.  In this case you don't need to include any individual sphere variables, and you can actually delete those rows if you like.  Alternatively, you can use the deity-based designations as the foundation, and add different access by specifying it.  So you can put "sphere_list = lathander_spheres / s_Destruction = focus" and now your priest of Lathander will have the usual Lathander spheres, plus focus access to Destruction.

- For each sphere your kit should have access to, change the 'x' to the level of access the kit should have: Minor, Major, or Focus.

Notes: 
- "Major" access means normal spell access, the kit can cast all spells in that sphere from levels 1 to 7.
- "Focus" access means your kit can cast all of those spells as if they were one level lower.  For example, Heal becomes a 5th level spell if you have focus access to the sphere of Life, and Resurrection can be cast with either a 6th or a 7th level slot.  (If your kit is a spontaneous-casting kit, the spells in a focus sphere will be learned for free, but will be cast at their normal level.)
- "Minor" access means you only get access to spells in that sphere that are levels 1 to 3.
- "Ranger" access and "Paladin" access are effectively the same as Major access; but, if the ranger and paladin spell tables don't give you access to high-level spells, then of course you won't be able to cast high-level spells (they will appear in your spellbook but you won't have any spell slots for casting them).

If your kit has major access or focus access to a sphere, the HLAs associated with that sphere will be added to your kit's custom HLA table, which will be automatically generated by the Faiths & Powers sphere system.

Generally, Faiths & Powers gives most kits access to about 11 or 12 spheres - half major access and half minor access.  For most cleric kits I suggest giving major access to about 6-7 spheres, and minor access to about 5-6 spheres.

Most spheres have 1-2 spells per level.  So a kit with major access to 6 spheres and minor access to 5 spheres will have 12-22 spells in its spellbook at levels 1 through 3, and 6-12 spells of levels 4 through 7.  The idea is, the number of available spells should be broad enough to get you comfortably through the game, but narrow enough to make the kit unique and flavorful.
