Mirrored Images is one of the most powerful of the illusionary spells, only available to high level Illusionists. 
Mirrored Clones creates two copies of the caster, perfect duplicates except for the fact that they have just 60% of the levels and hit points of the original individual. These duplicates are able to cast spells and attack under the control of the caster, who is also placed under a mislead-like effect for the entire duration of the spell.~
@303 = ~You cannot cast another spell of that type right now.~
