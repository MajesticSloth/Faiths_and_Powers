# Faiths_and_Powers
Faiths and Powers mod

**Compatibility**: Should be completely compatible with the following mods if installed after them:

- Spell Revisions
- Deities of Faer√ªn
- Divine Remix (do not install their sphere system)
- MORE

**Install Order**: TBD

## Component Overview

GIVE AN OVERVIEW OF EACH COMPONENT HERE.  Describe them more fully below

## Known Issues

- You MUST explicitly select a kit when prompted during character creation.  If you do not do so, you will end up with the old class and a likely very messed up spell list

**Component 101: Everything, Using Deity Selection Dialogue**

This Component has been depreciated.  In the initial implementation, we added deity kits by dialog due to engine limitations.  Recent updates to the game engine have rendered this technique unnecessary. 

**Component 102: ALL the new kits, the kit selection dialogue, and the sphere system ('radical version')**

This component radically alters the way classes and kits work in the game.  CONTINUE

## Component 102 

## Cleric Kits

**Cleric Overveiw**

There are no generic clerics in FnP if this component is installed.  All clerics must begin play begin play by answering the question, "what power do I worship?".  For most clerics, the answer will be some Farunian deity, but a few will have 'other answers' (see the 'Special Cleric Kits' section below).  

Typically, the Infinity Engine treats Clerics Specialists as Cleric kits.  In pnp, however, thera are _actual_ cleric kits that work in tandem with Priest Kits to create truely unique combinations.  Of course, we're not particularly fond of the cleric kits that you find in the Complete Priests Handbook--they're basically reskinned fighter kits--so we created our own.  Kits affect which deities you can select--in a few cases, such as the Ur-Priest, these kits dramatically influence deity selection (the Ur-Priest does not select any deity--see the kit below for details).  

In addition, some changes have been made to the cleric base kit, to further differentiate it from the paladin/champion (see below for details on the paladin changes).

## Special Cleric Kits

**Ur-Priest**

Ur-Priests are heretical practitioners that have found a way to wrest divine power from the gods with the use of ancient and forbidden rituals.  As might be expected, this behavior is frowned upon by the gods, and Ur-Priests have to keep their profession secret or risk persecution or worse.

Advantages:
- Sphere Access: Very high access.  The Ur-Priest gains major access to all spheres except the life, benediction, plant, animal and light spheres.
- Sap the Spirit: Ur-Priests can use the same techniques to drain living beings of their divine essence in much the same way they do so from the gods; though, of course, mortals do not have much of a divine essence, and so the benefits of this ability are limited.
This ability can be used once per day at fifth level.  The Ur-Priest can use Sap the Spirit an additional time per day at levels 10, 15 and 20.

SAP THE SPIRIT: This ability deals 1d4 magic damage to a living target per 4 levels of the Ur-Priest (2d4 at 5th level; maximum 6d4 at 20th level).
Beginning at 5th level, if the Ur-Priest kills a target with this ability, <PRO_HESHE> casts priest spells at +1 level for 5 rounds.  
At 10th level, if the Ur-Priest kills a target with this ability, <PRO_HESHE> also gains the benefits of the spell, Wondrous Recall.

Disadvantages:
- Cannot Turn Undead
- The rituals tax the Ur-Priest, making them more vulnerable to the effects of disease and magic.  They gain a -2 penalty to save vs. death and spells.

Deity access: None, despises the gods.

Restrictions: Cannot be of a good or lawful alignment

## Druid Kits

**Druid Overveiw**

Druids have been heavily overhauled in this component to cover a vast array of archetypes.  The base class has been replaced by Mystics as the term 'mystic' covers a larger number of character types, one of which is the typical druid.  As such, the druid itself has become a kit, with different sybtypes.
